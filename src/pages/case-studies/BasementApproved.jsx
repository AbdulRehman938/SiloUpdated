            Although the brand had strong recognition and a large social
            audience, the website lagged behind the needs of the community. It
            supported only standard articles, offered no way to display or play
            DJ mixes, and did not reflect the updated visual identity.
            BasementApproved needed a complete redesign and a robust Mixes
            system that could automatically pull content from Mixcloud without
            manual uploading.
          </p>

            BasementApproved also needed a smoother user experience, clearer
            structure and a platform that could scale with future content
            formats.

            The new identity gives Electrolytes With Joly a visual direction

            It brings consistency to how episodes are presented, strengthens the
            overall brand presence and provides assets that are simple to use as
            the show grows. The system supports both one off releases and long
            term content, giving the brand room to evolve while maintaining a
            strong sense of character.
