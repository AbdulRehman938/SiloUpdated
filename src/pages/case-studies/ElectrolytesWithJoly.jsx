            The new identity gives Electrolytes With Joly a visual direction
            that feels intentional and fully aligned with the tone of the show.
            It brings consistency to how episodes are presented, strengthens the
            overall brand presence and provides assets that are simple to use as
            the show grows. The system supports both one off releases and long
            term content, giving the brand room to evolve while maintaining a
            strong sense of character.
